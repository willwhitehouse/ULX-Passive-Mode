# ULX-Passive-Mode
A simple system where players can go into build/passive mode where they cannot be harmed nor harm other players for 5 mins (configurable) cannot be spammed due to cooldown time!
ULX/Ulib Is Needed! Or Else This Will Not Work!

Simply Place This In Your Addons Folder (ulx_passive folder) And Place The Contents Of The Lua Folder In Your Lua Folder!
EASY!
